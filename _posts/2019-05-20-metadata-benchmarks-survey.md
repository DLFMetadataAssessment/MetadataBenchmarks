As a part of the Digital Library Federation Forum Assessment Interest Group Metadata Working Group, the Metadata Quality Benchmarks subgroup created this survey to investigate metadata quality and how it is measured in libraries, archives, and museums. The goal of this survey is to gain insight into participantâ€™s methods and criteria for evaluating metadata quality and to identify potential gaps in present knowledge and practices. The survey will be open through June 30, 2019, or until a sufficient number of responses has been recorded. 

This survey is open to anyone self-identifying as a metadata professional who are currently employed in a library, archive, museum or other cultural heritage institution. Specifically, eligible participants for this study will be individuals with some responsibility for metadata management and/or creation for a digital repository.
